Introduction {#mainpage}
====================

The Experimental NPC Classes are a group of assorted SDX classes that, when combined, can provide hirable NPCs, troublesome bandits, and even animal husbandry!

Building upon the vanilla classes, we have included new hooks in Quests, Buffs, Entities, Dialogs and AI tasks. 

Explore and discover animals, tame them, and breed up your farms. Meet and greet NPCs in the world, completing their quests and earning their respect enough to follow you into the apocalypse. Everyone has their price, but can you afford them? Straight up hire various NPCs to protect and join you on your journey.
