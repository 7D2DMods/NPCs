Introduction {#mainpage}
====================

The Experimental NPC Classes are a group of assorted SDX classes that, when combined, can provide hirable NPCs, troublesome bandits, and even animal husbandry!

Building upon the vanilla classes, we have included new hooks in Quests, Buffs, Entities, Dialogs and AI tasks. 

Explore and discover animals, tame them, and breed up your farms. Meet and greet NPCs in the world, completing their quests and earning their respect enough to follow you into the apocalypse. Everyone has their price, but can you afford them? Straight up hire various NPCs to protect and join you on your journey.



### Experimental Testing Only! ###

The purpose of this initial release is not so much of a play test, as it is to view the work that is done, and provide feedback on areas for improvement. 

Commits are welcomed for changing and adjusting XML and Scripts.

Some of the features are not very polished yet, or complete. However, a good majority of the tasks outlined are done.

The XML in the Bloom's Animal Husbandry mod contains the life cycle Buff XMLs for animals, and can be applied to NPCs as well (they use the same base class). 

Sample dialog is available in the a_XUI_Dialog

Xyth_NPCs has sample entities along with their AI tasks and other XML configuration.
